<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

	<dt>Can I suggest someone to interview?</dt>
	<dd><em>Yes please!</em></dd>

	<dt>What's the background to all of this?</dt>
	<dd>It relates to the work I do. I'm interested in how Hackers learn and their choice of tooling. Universities have been sites for hacking since the 1950s. I'd like to understand that relationship better. Read more <a href="http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2012/02/25/hacking-the-university/">over here</a>.</dd>
