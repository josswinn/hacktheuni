<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hacking the University is a website of short interviews asking coders who work in universities about their craft.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<dl>
	<dt>What is a Hacker?</dt>
	<dd>I use the word fairly loosely. You might use the words 'coder', 'programer', or 'developer'. If you can relate to <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html" title="Hacker">this description</a>, then I'd say you are a Hacker. Sit proud!</dd>
	
	<dt>Can I suggest someone to interview?</dt>
	<dd><em>Yes please!</em></dd>

	<dt>What's the background to all of this?</dt>
	<dd>It relates to the work I do. I'm interested in how Hackers learn and their choice of tooling. Universities have been sites for hacking since the 1950s. I'd like to understand that relationship better. Read more <a href="http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2012/02/25/hacking-the-university/" title="Hacking the University">over here</a>.</dd>
	
	<dt>Are you only interested in Hackers working in UK universities?</dt>
	<dd>If you get paid to write code in a university, that's all that matters. It doesn't matter where you live.</dd>
	
	<dt>Where are all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing" title="Women in computing">women</a> who hack in universities?</dt>
	<dd>I'm looking for them. Maybe you can help me?</dd>

	<dt>How can I get in touch?</dt>
	<dd>Send an email to <a href="mailto:jwinn@lincoln.ac.uk">Joss</a>.</dd>
